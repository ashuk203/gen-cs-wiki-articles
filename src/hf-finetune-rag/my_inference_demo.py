        "cryptographic hash function: A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size (often called the \"message\") to a bit array of a fixed size (the \"hash value\", \"hash\", or \"message digest\"). It is a one-way function, that is, a function for which it is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation. Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hashes. Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography.",

It is a useful approach for designing information architecture, workflows, menu structure, or web site navigation paths.",
        "information leakage: Information leakage happens whenever a system that is designed to be closed to an eavesdropper reveals some information to unauthorized parties nonetheless. In other words: Information leakage occurs when secret information correlates with, or can be correlated with, observable information. For example, when designing an encrypted instant messaging network, a network engineer without the capacity to crack encryption codes could see when messages are transmitted, even if he could not read them.",

It involves various types or categories of controls, such as technical, procedural/administrative and physical."
